# Naive-Bayes-from-Scratch
Simple implementations of the Naive Bayes classifier built from scratch in Python. This project focuses on the core probabilistic logic, avoiding high-level ML libraries.
naive_bayes_scratch_categorical contains implementation of Naive Bayes on dataset having only Categorical or Multinomial features.
naive_bayes_scratch_gaussian&categorical contains implementation of Naive Bayes on dataset having both categorical and Gaussian features.
