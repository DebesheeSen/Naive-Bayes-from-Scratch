# Naive-Bayes-from-Scratch

Simple implementations of the Naive Bayes classifier built from scratch in Python. This project focuses on the core probabilistic logic, avoiding high-level machine learning libraries.

`naive_bayes_scratch_categorical` contains an implementation of Naive Bayes for datasets with exclusively categorical or multinomial features.

`naive_bayes_scratch_gaussian&categorical` contains an implementation of Naive Bayes designed for datasets with a mix of both categorical and continuous (Gaussian) features.

## Features

* **Pure Python Implementation**: Built from the ground up with a focus on fundamental Python and NumPy.
* **Multiple Variants**: Includes implementations for both categorical-only and mixed-type (Gaussian and categorical) datasets.
* **Educational Focus**: The code is written to be clear, readable, and easy to understand, making it ideal for learning the inner workings of the algorithm.
